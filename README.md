Deep Learning Project: Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction

Introduction

Problem Description: The goal of this project is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (target variable: deposit) based on their demographic and financial information. This is a binary classification problem where we aim to build a deep learning model to predict the outcome of a bank marketing campaign.

Dataset Description: The dataset contains information about clients, such as age, job, marital status, education, and financial details like balance and loan status. The target variable is deposit, which indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no).
